Title: Slides from Real Time Farms
Date: June 14, 2010

My latest project!

[Real Time Farms](http://realtimefarms.com/) is a live, local food guide. We want to help you find
fresh food in your area and get you excited about local food. There are lots of sites with farmers
market listings, but we thought they didn't address two issues:

First, when's the next market coming up in my area and where is it? Real simple, real important.

Second, pictures! Markets are wonderful visual experiences--we want to show you, not just tell you
about markets in your area.

Towards that, Real Time Farms has made an embeddable photo slideshow widget that you can put on your
own web page. It always displays the latest photos from whatever market you choose! We realized
early on that farmers market managers are wonderful allies. They're at the market every week and
looking for good ways to promote it. We decided the best way to get managers to help our effort, by
posting photos for example, is to provide awesome tools to help them do their jobs. No farmers
market site should be without up to date photos!
