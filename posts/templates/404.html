<h1 class="header">Page Not Found</h1>

<p>I can't find that page anywhere. I've had a few stiff drinks so I might just
have lost it, but I'm pretty sure I never had it. I'm a web server and it's my
job to serve pages! They don't just disappear you know!</p>

<p>Why don't you return to the <a href="/">main page</a>, and I'll let you know
if I find something.</p>
