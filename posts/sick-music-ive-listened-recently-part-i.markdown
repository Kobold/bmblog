Date: 2008-08-12 07:33:06

I listen to a lot of music. I listen to *a lot* of music. A minority of it happens to be "**sick**".

### Electronic

* Midnight Juggernauts' Dystopia - Very well composed with a Justice-y sound and a good dose of hard-as-shit rocking out.
* Danger's 09/14 2007 - More hard-as-shit rocking out, and only that.
* [Daft Punk's Alive 2007](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/47184-daft-punk-alive-2007) - I'll admit that I only just recently listened to this. It's rocking as fuck.

### Rock

* [M83's Saturdays=Youth](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/49915-m83-saturdaysyouth) - 80's inspired rock that's just ridiculously well composed.
* [The Kills' Midnight Boom](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/49362-the-kills-midnight-boom) - Bluesy noisy hard-ass rock. Their other albums are actually really good as well.
* [Autolux's Future Perfect](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15208-autolux-future-perfect) - Similar to The Kills, although slightly less hard. Just as fucking sweet.

### Disco

* [Hercules and Love Affair](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/49203-hercules-and-love-affair) - Disco is not dead. Brass instruments are sweet.

Also, Neutral Milk Hotel can suck it.
