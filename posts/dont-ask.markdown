Title: Don't ask
Date: 2008-06-23 23:59:27

I saw an acquaintance from high school the other day at the hardware store. She was working the counter with another guy. I was buying xylene and sodium hydroxide, not that suspicious...

> Her: Oh hey! How have you been doing?
>
> Me: Not bad. How about you?
>
> *blah, blah*
>
> Counter Guy: \*conversationally\* What's this stuff for?
> 
> Me: \*pause\*
> 
> Counter Guy: \*grinning\* Nevermind. I should know better than to ask.
>
> Her: \*quizzical smile\*
>
> Me: Bye, it was nice seeing you!

I love leaving people wondering.
