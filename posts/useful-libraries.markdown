Title: Useful Libraries
Date: 2009-06-16

There's nothing better than finding a library that does exactly what you're
looking for with a clean and sane API. I'll gradually add to this posting as
it strikes me.

Libraries I Like

[flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) A pure canvas/JS plotting library
that is very flexible and generates pretty graphs. It's API is clean and very
javascript-esque. One particularly nice feature that's not present in a lot of
plotting libraries, but I use all the time, is handling times and dates.

Libraries I Haven't Tried--Yet
------------------------------

These libraries look interesting if I ever need them. I haven't tried them
yet, so no endorsements, but they look good.

[Really Simple History](http://code.google.com/p/reallysimplehistory/) "Really
Simple History is a lightweight JavaScript library for the management of
bookmarking and browser history in Ajax/DHTML applications."
