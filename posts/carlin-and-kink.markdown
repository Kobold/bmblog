Title: Carlin and kink
Date: 2008-06-25 20:18:40

George Carlin died. I'm sure he wouldn't want me to wallow, so I got out my cutlery and tanning equipment. George, I'm going to have to say thank you. You make a great jacket.

In one of his performances, he claims that [rape can be funny](http://youtube.com/watch?v=3av_qRR_DWc&feature=related). It's actually pretty funny. The example rape he uses for humor dodges being real, though. I just found another, more direct, instance of [funny rape](http://www.reddit.com/info/6n6y2/comments/c04cihq):

> How safe is Rohypnol?
>
> I'd like to date rape my own girlfriend. Probably consensually, but one of those 'one time in the next 5 or so times we go out, I will date rape you, ok' kind of ways.
>
> It might be fun.
>
> I am being totally serious as well, I don't want to do it if she will have an ill effects - but will she be lucid enough to get a thrill off it?

*Real* kinky.
